    "prompt": "Editorial documentary style photograph of a professional venture capitalist, age 30s, in a modern minimalist office with natural window lighting during twilight. The subject is seated at a desk with a quality notebook, pen, and coffee mug, engaged in thoughtful work; environment shows subtle signs of use (papers, slight clutter), with sophisticated, desaturated color grading, cool blue hour tonality and soft amber highlights. Medium shot with intelligent negative space, subtle background softness, and authentic, focused expression—conveys quiet intensity and clarity in high-stakes decision-making.

    "prompt": "A modern, editorial documentary-style photograph of a confident venture capitalist in their early 30s, seated at a minimalist office desk with natural window light streaming in. The subject is thoughtfully reviewing notes in a quality notebook, with a coffee mug and pen nearby, suggesting a high-stakes decision-making moment. The environment is professional but lived-in, featuring subtle textures and muted tones. The lighting is soft and diffused, echoing blue hour tonality with deep indigo shadows and gentle amber highlights. The color grading is sophisticated and slightly desaturated, with cool environmental tones and warm skin tones. Composition uses intelligent negative space and off-center framing, with subtle background blur to provide depth. No screens, no text, no abstract patterns—only authentic human focus and purposeful workspace details.",
